# ESX-LS-Tow
ESX LS Tow is a menu/script made for server tow truck drivers. This script allows drivers to publicly go on duty to offer their services to other players, and do the default
ESX tow job services as normal. The menu allows players to purchase vehicles and go on duty to the public server with custom notifications made by Switty6 (linked below).
When going on duty, the players job is also automatically set to mechanic. When going off duty, it is set to unemployed.
